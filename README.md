📊 Telecom Customer Churn Analysis
   -> This repository contains a complete analysis of Telecom Customer Churn using Python.
   -> It includes data exploration, visualizations, preprocessing, and churn insights as part of the AI & ML Bootcamp.


📁 Project Files
  -> AI&ML Bootcamp.ipynb – Main notebook with data analysis
  -> AI&ML_Bootcamp_improved.ipynb – Clean and organized notebook with full visuals
  -> telecom_churn_viz.py – Python script containing visualization code only
  -> TelecomCustomerChurn.csv – Dataset (if added)
  -> README.md – Project documentation


📚 Dataset Overview
  The dataset contains information about telecom customers, including:

  -> Customer demographics
  -> Services subscribed
  -> Contract type
  -> Monthly and total charges
  -> Whether the customer churned (Yes/No)
 

 📊 Visualizations Included
    -> Churn distribution (bar & pie charts)
    -> Histograms for numerical features
    -> Tenure vs Monthly Charges scatter plot
    -> Contract vs Churn analysis
    -> Churn percentage by contract type
    -> Boxplot of tenure by churn status
    -> Correlation heatmap (numeric features)
 

 🛠 Technologies Used
  -> Python
  -> Pandas
  -> NumPy
  -> Matplotlib
  -> Jupyter Notebook
  

 🧩 Future Enhancements
   -> Add machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
   -> Add feature importance & SHAP analysis
   -> Deploy churn prediction using Streamlit
